# Aquiles LoopStation
This is meant to be a semi-replica of Ed Sheeran's Chewie Monsta 2 (MIDI Loop Pedal)  
It's based off an Arduino Uno for the microcontroller, 10 footswitches, 1 rotary encoder, and NeoPixel LEDs  
Using the library FastLED to control the LEDs  
The PCB design can be found here: https://easyeda.com/tomatos/loopmidi  
This LoopStation also uses the program Mobius (by CircularLabs), which can be found here: http://www.circularlabs.com/download2/download.html
For the pedal to work the scripts must be configured (each with its own MIDI trigger)


To install:
Go to the folder inside Loop Pedal Programs, Files, Scripts/Mobius/userdata and copy its contents inside this path on your computer:
C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Mobius 2

After that, go to the folder inside Loop Pedal Programs, Files, Scripts/Mobius/general_config_files and copy its contents inside this path on your computer:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Mobius 2\

Also copy the scripts and paste them on the corresponding path (C:\Program Files (x86)\Mobius 2\scripts)
