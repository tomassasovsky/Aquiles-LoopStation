# Loop Pedal - Chewie Monsta 2  
This is my go at building a semi-replica of Ed Sheeran's Chewie Monsta 2  
This pedal will have:  
 1. Two Modes (Play and Rec)  
 2. Ten different pedals:  
    -Rec/Play button  
  -Stop button  
  -Undo button  
  -Mode button  
  -4 Track buttons (for 4 individual tracks)  
  -Clear button  
  -X2 (Multiply) button  
 3. An Arduino Uno, to communicate to the computer running Mobius
 4. 5 LEDs, one to display the current mode of the pedal (either Play Mode or Record Mode) and one for each track, to display its state (Red is recording, Green is playing, Off is muted or empty)   
 5. A display
