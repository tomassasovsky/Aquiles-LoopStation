# Loop Pedal - Chewie Monsta 2  
This is my go at building a replica of Ed Sheeran's Chewie Monsta 2  
This pedal will have:  
  -2 Modes (Play and Rec)  
  -11 different pedals:  
     -Rec/Play button  
     -Stop button  
     -Undo button  
     -Mode button  
     -4 Track buttons (for 4 individual tracks)  
     -Clear button  
     -Bank button  
     -Reset button  
  -An Arduino Uno, to communicate to the program MÃ¶bius  
  -5 LEDs, one to display the current mode of the pedal (either Play or Rec) and one for each track, to display its state  
  -A display  
The Arduino bootloader can be changed to be recognized by the computer as a USB MIDI device, or the programs LoopMIDI and Hairless MIDI SERIAL can be used to bridge the MIDI communication between the Arduino and the computer itself.
