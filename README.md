# Loop Pedal - Chewie Monsta 2  
This is my go at building a replica of Ed Sheeran's Chewie Monsta 2  
This pedal will have:  
 1. Two Modes (Play and Rec)  
 2. Eleven different pedals:  
    -Rec/Play button  
  -Stop button  
  -Undo button  
  -Mode button  
  -4 Track buttons (for 4 individual tracks)  
  -Clear button  
  -Bank button  
  -Reset button  
 3. An Arduino Uno, to communicate to the program MÃ¶bius  
 4. 5 LEDs, one to display the current mode of the pedal (either Play or Rec) and one for each track, to display its state  
 5. A display  

The Arduino bootloader can be changed to be recognized by the computer as a USB MIDI device, or the programs LoopMIDI and Hairless MIDI SERIAL can be used to bridge the MIDI communication between the Arduino and the computer itself.
