# Aquiles LoopStation
This is meant to be a semi-replica of Ed Sheeran's Chewie Monsta 2 (MIDI Loop Pedal)  
It's based off an Arduino Uno for the microcontroller, 10 footswitches, 1 rotary encoder, and NeoPixel LEDs  
Using the library FastLED to control the LEDs  
The PCB design can be found here: https://easyeda.com/tomatos/loopmidi  
This LoopStation also uses the program Mobius (by CircularLabs), which can be found here: http://www.circularlabs.com/download2/download.html
For the pedal to work the scripts must be configured (each with its own MIDI trigger)
